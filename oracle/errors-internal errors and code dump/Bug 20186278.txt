Description

    BDB retension time suddenly change to 1094795585 or some other huge value.
    This may cause crfclust.bdb file to grow in size, as crflogd tries to keep 
    data for longer retention. 
     
    Rediscovery Notes
     
    When hitting this problem, crflogd.log may show the retention size being 
    suddenly updated to a large size. 
     
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     2014-02-03 15:36:29.799: [ CRFLOGD][2363541248]updateDBRetention: new retention is 1094795585 seconds and 4702111234474983745 bytes
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     
    Current retention value may be checked with following command. 
    If the retention value (unit: seconds) shows a large value like 
    1094795585, you are likely to have hit this problem.
     
     $ oclumon manage -get repsize
     CHM Repository Size = 1094795585
     
    Workaround
     
    Modify BDBSIZE parameter in config file crf<hostname>.ora to 
    adequately lower value. To do so, follow these steps:
     
    1. Issue "$GI_HOME/bin/crsctl stop res ora.crf -init " on all the nodes of cluster.
    2. Locate the config file $GRID_HOME/crf/admin/crf<hostname>.ora
    3. Manually edit the crf<hostname>.ora file on every node of the cluster and
       change BDBSIZE tag entry and remove the value (set it to blank) or 
       set it to a desired value, eg. 61511. Do not delete the BDBSIZE tag itself.
    4. Restart ora.crf daemon on every node.

Hi
 数据库的crfclust.bdb文件异常大，查询文章说是bug
Bug 20186278 - crfclust.bdb Becomes Huge Size Due to Sudden Retention Change ( Doc ID 20186278.8 )
请确认这个问题。

ora.crf服务是为Cluster Health Monitor（以下简称CHM）提供服务的，用来自动收集操作系统的资源（CPU、内存、SWAP、进程、I/O以及网络等）的使用情况。
ora.crf服务生成的文件（$GI_HOME/crf/db/$HOMENAME/目录中所有的 crf*.bdb和$HOSTNAME.ldb ）
http://blog.csdn.net/msdnchina/article/details/49403105

WORKAROUNDS:
 To free memory:
 "$GI_HOME/bin/crsctl stop res ora.crf -init" on all nodes
 cd $GI_HOME/crf/db/<nodename>
 rm *.bdb
 $GI_HOME/bin/crsctl start res ora.crf -init

 To reset the BDBSIZE:
 1. Issue "$GI_HOME/bin/crsctl stop res ora.crf -init " on all the nodes of
 cluster.
 2. Locate the file crf<hostname>.ora file (found in <GIHOME>/crf/admin
 directory).
 3. Manually edit the crf<hostname>.ora file on every node of the cluster as
 follows.
 a. Locate the BDBSIZE tag entry in the above file and remove the value
(set it to blank), do not delete the BDBSIZE tag
4. Restart the ora.crf daemon on every node

只停CRF，对RAC和数据库无影响。
