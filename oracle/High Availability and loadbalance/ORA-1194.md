Purpose
The goal of this article is to assist DBAs who encounter the following errors at database open:
ORA-1194 "file %s needs more recovery to be consistent"
ORA-1547 "warning: RECOVER succeeded but OPEN RESETLOGS would get error below"
ORA-1110 "data file %s: '%s'"
 
 
Scope
This article is meant for database administrators and backup and recovery specialists tasked with the restore and recovery of a database
Details
Assuming that all datafiles were either successfully restored, and/or recovery was done with existing database datafiles, but failed to open with the below:
 
ORA-01547: warning: RECOVER succeeded but OPEN RESETLOGS would get error below
ORA-01194: file 1 needs more recovery to be consistent
ORA-01110: data file 1: '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/V1123/system01.dbf'
 
The ORA-01547 before database open indicates that Oracle sees the datafiles as inconsistent. This is resolved by applying more recovery, to make the datafiles consistent.
Checks to Perform
1.  Check the current status of the datafiles:
set numwidth 30;
set pagesize 50000;
alter session set nls_date_format = 'DD-MON-RRRR HH24:MI:SS';
select status,checkpoint_change#,checkpoint_time, resetlogs_change#, resetlogs_time, count(*), fuzzy from v$datafile_header group by status,checkpoint_change#,checkpoint_time, resetlogs_change#, resetlogs_time, fuzzy;
 
The goal is to have the above query return 1 row and fuzzy column value as NO.
 
NOTE:  if checkpoint_change# in query returns 0, this indicates that Oracle cannot read the file header.  This is possibly because the location and name of the datafile within the controlfile is not the one on disk.  
 
 2.  Check the archivelog sequence numbers needed to recover the files.  Execute:
select min(fhrba_Seq), max(fhrba_Seq) from X$KCVFH;
 
This query will show the smallest and largest sequence needed by the datafiles.    To make the datafiles consistent, you must apply all archivelog files within the above range of sequence numbers.  This can be one or many archivelog files.  
 
NOTE:  This query will not be valid in a RAC environment.  In RAC, find the necessary sequences from all threads using the smallest (and largest) checkpoint_change# returned by the query in #1 and execute:
 
select thread#, first_change#, next_change# from v$archived_log where <smallest/largest checkpoint_change#> between first_change# and next_change#;
 
once the above is executed with the smallest and largest checkpoint_change#, you have the sequence range needed to be applied from all threads of the RAC database.  See Note 243760.1 'RMAN: RAC Backup and Recovery using RMAN' for more details.
 
3.  Once further recovery is applied, confirm the datafiles are consistent with query in #1, above, until the goal is accomplished.  
 
4.  Once all datafiles are consistent and fuzzy=NO, the database can be opened and the ORA-01547 should no longer be returned.
 
 
Scenario 1: Current Controlfile is Used for Recovery
If the CURRENT CONTROLFILE is in use, and all online redo logs are available, then you can simply run RECOVER DATABASE. This will apply all archivelogs, and the current online redolog.
 
1) Ensure instance is MOUNTed and ALL datafiles  are ONLINE (SYSTEM datafiles will have the status of SYSTEM)
SQL> select name, controlfile_type from v$database ;
 
   NAME      CONTROL
   --------- -------
   V1123     CURRENT 
 
   SQL> select status from v$instance;
 
   STATUS
   ------------
   MOUNTED
 
   SQL> select distinct(status) from v$datafile;
 
   STATUS
   -------
   ONLINE
   SYSTEM
 
 
2) Recover and open the database:
   SQL> recover automatic database ;  
    ..
   Media recovery complete    
   SQL> alter database open
   Database altered.
 
 
Scenario 2: Backup Controlfile is Used for recovery
Please see steps below showing you an example getting the errors like ORA-1194, ORA-1547, ORA-1110,
and how to verify status of Controlfile, Datafiles, Logfiles, and finally recover and open database.

If you use a "BACKUP CONTROLFILE", or previously used a CANCEL based recover command, then we need to recover, and finally apply the online current redolog.

--   THEN  "Min PITR ABSSCN"  is the SCN we must recover to to get all datafiles consistent
 
ABSSCN = Absolute SCN 
 
Comment:
 
In the above output/sample we see, redo (archivelogs)  was applied and datafile 6 was rolled forward but still needs more recovery and redo to be applied.
Database Recovery did not complete, because the online 'current' redolog is not applied automatically with a 'BACKUP' controlfile.
As we use a Backup Controlfile we must 'manually' apply the online 'current' redolog '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/V1123/redo01.log' having SEQ# 454  ( SCN 2472049)  !
 
 
Additional Note:
 
As this is recover with a Backup Controlfile, or controlfile create from  Tracefile (sql> alter database backup to trace;) ,
query of v$log/v$logfile will possibly not give the correct information, about which logfile contains which sequence number (seq#).
 
# Options to find the Online log to be used
 
   a: Check the Alert.log file for the last sequences used with 'Online Redolog files'
 
   b: If Alert.log is lost you may simply try all online redolog files, if the wrong logfile is chosen nothing will be applied,
      but you will see in in the output message which sequence is in that online redolog file.
      Then simply try the next online redolog file until you get 'media recovery complete' message.
 
   c: You may also dump the file log file headers for Online redolog file(s)   
      Example:
      --------
      sql> alter system dump logfile '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/V1123/redo01.log' scn min 1 scn max 1 ;
   
      -- This will write a tracefile with the header dump to your 'trace' (11g) [ or udump (<=10g) ] directory
      -- Check the tracefile for similar entry like...
      ~~~
      ..
       descrip:"Thread 0001, Seq# 0000000454 ...
       ..
