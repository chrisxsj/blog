CAUSE
There is an RMAN backup of these archive logs taken to disk.

However, the RMAN backup script shows a KEEP attribute on the database backup.  The archive logs are required to meet the KEEP attribute for the database backup.

The backup of the archivelog has the KEEP attribute, it does not count towards the number of backups of this particular
archivelog, and so the backup directive '...backed up 1 times...' is not satisfied, and the archivelog is not deleted.

The RMAN backup script shows:

RUN {
ALLOCATE CHANNEL disk_level_1 DEVICE TYPE DISK format '/<Path>/%d/%d_daily_level_1_%T_%p_%u.DBP';
BACKUP AS COMPRESSED BACKUPSET INCREMENTAL LEVEL 1 database plus archivelog TAG daily_level_1 keep until time 'sysdate+45';
}

SOLUTION
 The RMAN backups will be marked as obsolete when the user defined backup policy of "keep until time 'sysdate+45' is met.

If you wish to delete the RMAN backups you may use the RMAN change command to change or remove the 'keep' parameter.

For example, specify RMAN>  CHANGE ... NOKEEP to remove the KEEP attributes for a backup
