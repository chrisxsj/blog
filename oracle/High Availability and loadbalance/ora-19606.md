ORA-19606: Cannot copy or restore to snapshot control file

CAUSE

=== ODM Cause Determination ===

The snapshot controlfile is cataloged as a controlfile copy and is now obsolete. RMAN cannot delete this file as it is used by rman.


=== ODM Cause Justification ===

Error and information supplied justifies cause.

SOLUTION

=== ODM Solution / Action Plan ===

The snapshot controlfile must be removed as a valid controlfile copy.  To do this, you would:

RMAN>  change controlfilecopy 'C:\APP\ADMINISTRATOR\PRODUCT\11.2.0\DBHOME_1\DATABASE\SNCFAXMPRD.ORA' uncatalog;

Confirm with:

RMAN>  list copy of controlfile;
