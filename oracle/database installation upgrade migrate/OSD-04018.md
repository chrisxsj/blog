From explorer   Archives(\\Machine)(J:)

I have tried several combinations including double and single quotes...   Oracle is running as an admin presently in mounted standby mode.

alter system set standby_archive_dest="J:\"
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-02097: parameter cannot be modified because specified value is invalid
ORA-16032: parameter STANDBY_ARCHIVE_DEST destination string cannot be translated
ORA-09291: sksachk: invalid device specified for archive destination

Hi JoelTry setting it as 
alter system set standby_archive_dest="\\Machine\Archives"

See Note 337413.1 Cannot Recognize Remote Mapped Drive ORA-09291 [ID 337413.1]

Hope this helps
