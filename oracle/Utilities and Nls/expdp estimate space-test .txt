ESTIMATE

 Default: BLOCKS

 Purpose

 Specifies the method that Export will use to estimate how much disk space each table in the export job will consume (in bytes). The estimate is printed in the log file and displayed on the client's standard output device. The estimate is for table row data only; it does not include metadata.

 Syntax and Description
 ESTIMATE=[BLOCKS | STATISTICS]


 •BLOCKS - The estimate is calculated by multiplying the number of database blocks used by the source objects, times the appropriate block sizes.


 •STATISTICS - The estimate is calculated using statistics for each table. For this method to be as accurate as possible, all tables should have been analyzed recently. (Table analysis can be done with either the SQL ANALYZE statement or the DBMS_STATS PL/SQL package.)


Restrictions

If the Data Pump export job involves compressed tables, the default size estimation given for the compressed table is inaccurate when ESTIMATE=BLOCKS is used. This is because the size estimate does not reflect that the data was stored in a compressed form. To get a more accurate size estimate for compressed tables, use ESTIMATE=STATISTICS.


ESTIMATE_ONLY
Default: n
Purpose
Instructs Export to estimate the space that a job would consume, without actually performing the export operation.
Syntax and Description

ESTIMATE_ONLY={y | n}



If ESTIMATE_ONLY=y, then Export estimates the space that would be consumed, but quits without actually performing the export operation.

 使用ESTIMATE_ONLY 的时候，不能加 dumpfile 参数，否则会报如下错：
 ORA-39002: invalid operation
 ORA-39201: Dump files are not supported for estimate only jobs
